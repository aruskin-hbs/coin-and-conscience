# Notes and observations

- Many-to-many relationship between artists and works
    - e.g., Cornelis Cort associated with works 3 and 10
    - e.g., Dirck Volkertsz Coornhert, Cornelis Cort, Maarten van Heemskerck, Hieronymus Cock all associated with work 3
- More specific relationships between artists and works described in text of `artistInfo` section of works, but not captured in a structured way - potential improvement for us to pursue
    - e.g., "Engraving by Dirck Volkertsz. Coornhert (1519–90), or Cornelis Cort (1533–78), after Maarten van Heemskerck (1498–1574). Published by Hieronymus Cock (1510–70)."
- Links from works redirect to IIIF viewer with different IDs - probably want to capture new URLs/IDs
    - e.g., original URL http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HBS.BAKER:836614?buttons=y&caption=Historical+Collections,+Baker+Library,+Harvard+Business+School redirects to https://iiif.lib.harvard.edu/manifests/view/ids:3910429
